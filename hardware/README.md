# Jianovka

Jianovka is a chorded keyboard that looks similar to Jian or Corne keyboard, but uses chords instead of layers. Columnar stagger and thumb cluster are copied from Jian keyboard, but far-far-away pinky key removed. So Jianovka looks more like Jian, but has 42 keys like Corne.

This keyboard is designed to be made with Hall effect switches and keys from vintage Zbrojovka 262.3 keyboard, Teensy 2.0 microcontroller and QMK firmware.
